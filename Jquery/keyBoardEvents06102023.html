The order of events
When user presses a key or combination of different keys, `keydown`, `keypress` and `keyup` are triggered in that order:
The `keydown` event is triggered first when user presses a key
The `keyup` event is triggered last when user releases a key
In between, the `keypress` event is triggered
These events serve different purposes.
The `keydown` and `keyup` events are often used to handle the physical keys, while the `keypress` event is used to handle characters which are being typed.
The `keypress` ignores keys such as `delete`, `arrows`, `page up`, `page down`, `home`, `end`, `ctrl`, `alt`, `shift`, `esc`, etc. So, if we need to handle those keys, it's better to use either `keydown` or `keyup` event.
